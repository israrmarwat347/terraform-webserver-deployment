# Terraform Infrastructure with Userdata Scripts

This repository contains Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts to provision cloud infrastructure and deploy a simple web page inside a container on a virtual machine. It includes shell scripts (`userdata.sh` and `userdata2.sh`) that automate setup tasks and output container information.

|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `main.tf`               | Main Terraform configuration defining infrastructure resources.                              |
| `provider.tf`           | Cloud provider configuration and provider settings.                                         |
| `variable.tf`           | Definitions and explanations of variables used in the Terraform scripts.                     |
| `userdata.sh`           | Shell script to create a basic HTML page on the provisioned instance.                        |
| `userdata2.sh`          | Shell script that creates an HTML page and outputs the container ID after deployment.       |
| `terraform.tfstate`     | Terraform state file tracking the current infrastructure state (auto-generated).            |
| `terraform.tfstate.backup` | Backup of Terraform state file (auto-generated).                                         |


## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed on your local machine ([Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli))
- Access and credentials for your cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of Terraform and shell scripting.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo-directory>
   
2. Initialize Terraform
Download necessary provider plugins and initialize the environment:
Also in provider.tf put your user access key of provide and also also secret acces key 

#bash
terraform init

3. Configure variables
Review and update variables in variable.tf or create a terraform.tfvars file with your custom values.

4. Deploy the infrastructure
Run Terraform apply to create the infrastructure:

#bash
terraform apply
#Confirm the action when prompted.

#Verify deployment
After deployment, the container ID will be output in the terminal (from userdata2.sh), confirming successful container creation.

How It Works
Terraform provisions the cloud resources defined in main.tf using your provider settings.
The user data scripts (userdata.sh or userdata2.sh) run on instance startup to:
Create a simple HTML page served by the instance.

Launch a container.
Output the container ID to confirm the container is running.

Notes
The terraform.tfstate and terraform.tfstate.backup files are generated by Terraform to track state and should not be committed to public repositories. Add them to .gitignore if necessary.
Customize the HTML content and container behavior by modifying the userdata.sh and userdata2.sh scripts.
Ensure your cloud provider credentials and permissions are correctly configured before running Terraform.
